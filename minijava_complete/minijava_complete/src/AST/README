This subdirectory contains the declarations of classes in the AST
representation of a program in our simple demo language, based off
of the AST classes found on the MiniJava website.  These have been
changed to also keep track of the line number in the original code
on which the AST element was found, as well as adding a separate
Display node only used in the toy language, but not for MiniJava.
Additional minor changes to replace Vector with List/ArrayList and
use type parameters where appropriate.
