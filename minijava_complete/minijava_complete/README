This is the start of a simple compiler which you can modify to compile
the MiniJava language.  To demonstrate the basics of scanning and
parsing, as well as to provide some basic structure, we're providing a
"compiler" that will scan and parse "programs" in the following tiny
programming language:

	program ::= statement | program statement
	statement ::= assignStmt | displayStmt
	assignStmt ::= id = expr ;
	displayStmt ::= display expr ;
	expr ::= id | expr + expr | ( expr )
	id ::= [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9_]*

The AST classes provided are closely based on those provided from the
MiniJava website, slightly modified to add tracking of line numbers,
as well as adding a separate Display node only used in the toy
language, but not for MiniJava.  They have also been updated to use
Lists with type parameters instead of the original Vector class.

All of the compiler source code is in the src directory.

The TestScanner and TestParser classes are examples of how to use the
scanner and parser in a compiler.  The rest of the compiler is stored
in several subdirectories:

    Scanner: the implementation of a demo scanner

    Parser: the implementation of a demo parser

    AST: the implementation of the abstract syntax tree

The lib directory stores the jar files for CUP and JFlex that are
needed to build and run the compiler and a couple of source files from
CUP that may be useful for reference.

SamplePrograms contains a sample program in the example language,
which you can replace with MiniJava programs to be be compiled and run
to test your MiniJava compiler as you develop it.  The
SampleMiniJavaPrograms directory contains larger MiniJava programs for
testing.

The build.xml ant file supports building, running, and testing the
demo compiler scanning and parsing examples.  Look at it for details.
